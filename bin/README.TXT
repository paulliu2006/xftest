Welcome!

This classpath contains a VERY simple example of how iBATIS can be
configured and used.  It is NOT a best practices example, instead
it shows you the basics of iBATIS in the simplest form possible 
(i.e. lots of static methods ;-)

Browse through it, get a feel for it.  If you like, you can copy
the XML files to your own project to use as a starting point.

For a more complete example - and best practices - please see 
the JPetStore example application at http://www.ibatis.com

Best regards,
