JAR File Dependencies
---------------------

iBATIS 2.0 requires JDK 1.4

All other libraries and JAR files are completely optional. Here's
a summary of those libraries and when you need to use them.  The versions
listed here are simply the version tested.  Higher versions may or may not 
work.

  * If you want to use bytecode enhancement for advanced lazy loading:

      CGLIB 2.0              (http://cglib.sf.net)

  * If you want to use the Jakarta DBCP connection pool you'll need:

      DBCP 1.1               (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dbcp/)

  * If you want to use distributed caching you'll need:

      OSCache 2.0.1          (http://www.opensymphony.com/oscache/)

  * If you want to use advanced logging you'll need one or both of the following:

      Commons Logging        (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/)
      Log4J 1.2.8            (http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/)

That's it!
